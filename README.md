# Tile Map Editor

Simple Tile Map Editor made with Flutter, for RPG games.

The idea is to create a Tile Map Editor, which creates several maps (levels), for role-playing games.

You will be able to upload tilesets, create your map and then export it as an image in PNG format.

I also have the idea of adding more features in the Tile Map Editor, as the whole Harveu project develops.

But the focus now is to develop the Tile Map Editor, so that it is possible to start the game with some maps ready.

## Why?

The Tile Map Editor, is the first tool of the Harveu project, which will be an RPG Game made in Flutter.

I'm using what I learned from watching some tutorials, and inspired by [Drew Conley](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrewConley), who has several great videos on his YouTube channel, creating Javascript games. I will try to pass on the acquired knowledge to Flutter.

## The begin

I'm still learning, so at first the sprites are from [Drew's](https://www.youtube.com/c/DrewConley) tutorials. But in the future, I will replace the sprites with my own, according to what I learn, as the project progresses.

I'll try to code every day, but the project is to improve my skills with game development (developing one, in this case, haha) and having fun with the challenges of doing this project of transcribing web knowledge to Flutter.
